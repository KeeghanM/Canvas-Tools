Canvas Tools
------------

This is a small, simple, and most likely highly inefficient way to draw and manipulate the HTML 5 Canvas.

Created as an experiment so I could learn more about manipulating the Canvas Element, it really shouldn't be used for more than just playing around.

The canvas-tools.js file is the "library" itself, and index.html and index.js are the example/testing files.
